    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        During the COVID-19 Pandemic we had seen a surge in online transactions. The current wallet payment architecture requires online connectivity during 
        transactions. It was observed that there is a possibility of not getting connected to the Internet due to various reasons. In this project, we worked on a solution to enable 
        offline transactions due to any internet failure. We identified three main scenarios where fully offline transaction capability was considered to be beneficial for 
        both merchants and consumers. It included making purchases in locations without online connectivity, when a reliable connection is not guaranteed, and when it is 
        cheaper to carry out offline transactions due to higher communication/payment processing costs involved in online approvals. Our work aimed to address the challenge 
        of providing a secure offline transaction capability when there was no online connectivity keeping in mind to not compromise any security features in our 
        M-Commerce offline wallet payment application.
