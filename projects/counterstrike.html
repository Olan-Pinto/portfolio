    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p  style="text-align: justify;">
        In this project we analyse and predict the nature
        of a very famous first-person shooting computer game,
        Counter Strike Global Offensive. A lot of data from official
        CS:GO tournaments are collected for the analysis, and we aim
        to assess this data with primary focus on two aspects: game
        play analysis and rounds system. In-depth research has been
        done on game play analysis and round systems to provide
        accurate predictions and insightful data. Using standard machine learning models, feature engineering
        and optimization, our model is up to 70% accurate for a game
        with low game refinement i.e., the game is highly skillful.
        Throughout the course of this project we analyse several key
        aspects in game-play which can be used as an advantage by
        several professional Counter Strike players. Furthermore, round
        prediction has also been incorporated. Several Machine Learning algorithms like
        Machine Learning, Descriptive Analysis, Inferential
        Analysis, Game Refinement, K Nearest Neighbour, Random
        Forest Classifier, Multi Layer Perceptron Model have been
        applied and compared to obtain the best results possible.
