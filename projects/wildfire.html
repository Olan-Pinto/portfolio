    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Wildfires are increasingly becoming a global challenge, especially in regions like California,
        where they threaten both human life and the environment. This project leverages machine
        learning and deep learning techniques to develop a model to predict wildfire occurrences,
        integrating both satellite data and meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind
        speed, and precipitation. Using data from the NASA FIRMS API and Open-Meteo, we analyzed
        wildfire occurrences in Southern California from 2020 to 2024. The project includes geospatial
        and temporal analyses to uncover patterns in wildfire frequency and density. It also explores how
        weather factors influence the likelihood of wildfires.
        The dataset contains fire and non-fire occurrences and will be used to train machine learning
        models to predict wildfires, providing actionable insights for effective wildfire management. We
        found that temperature and humidity are the most significant factors in predicting wildfire
        outbreaks, with most occurrences happening during the hottest months, June to September. This
        model could help in implementing early-warning systems and better resource allocation for
        wildfire prevention and control efforts in areas of high risk.
