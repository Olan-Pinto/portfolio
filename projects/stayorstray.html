    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p  style="text-align: justify;">
      There are a large number of hotel bookings that
      are called off everyday either because the customer canceled
      the booking or that they just did not appear (no-show). More
      often than not, the reason for cancellation includes conflicts in
      schedules or change of plans. Some hotels offer a free cancellation
      option or cancellation at a low cost. This method may be
      beneficial to hotel guests but not so to the hotel company cause it
      may have a diminishing effect on revenue. The losses incurred by
      hotels are really high when these cancellations are made at the
      11th hour. Cancellation losses mean that hotels could lose revenue
      because they would not be able to resell the room in time, or
      an increase in commission to advertising companies to help sell
      rooms on short notice or lowering the price to reduce the profit
      margin. None of these scenarios help the hotel management in any
      way whatsoever and therefore calls for a deeper research of what
      factors lead to hotel cancellations. This paper uses a dataset from
      the INN Hotels Group based out of the United Kingdom to try
      and use statistical and Machine Learning concepts to understand
      the reasons that led to hotel cancellations. The goal of this paper
      is to perform exploratory data analysis - both univariate and
      bivariate analysis to see trends within the dataset, to build on
      hypothesis tests and test our initial hypothesis and finally build a
      predictive model that can effectively forecast whether a booking
      is likely to be canceled in the future or not.
